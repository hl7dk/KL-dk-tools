This repository contains Local Goverment Denmark (Kommunernes Landsforening) FHIR profiles and documentation relating to questionaires and observations. Local Goverment Denmark is a non-profit organisation financed by the Danish municipalities. The Danish municipalities deliver health and social care in homes, nursing homes and local facilities.

The Implementation guide is a derivative of the Common Municipality Information Model (FKI). The FKI FHIR profiles can be used to exchange and report health care and social care data from Danish municipalities. See more her: http://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7dk/KL-dk/
