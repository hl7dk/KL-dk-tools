Initial release of FFInst

This is the initial release of FFInst. It contains FHIR profiles and documentation relating to questionaires and observations, specified by Local Government Denmark. These first observations and questionnaires are the most commonly used in municipality disease prevention and health promotion. However, they are so general in their scope with e.g. vital signs and WHO5 quesuionnaire that they can be used in other areas as well.
